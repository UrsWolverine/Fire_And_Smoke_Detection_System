# Fire and Smoke Detection System

## Overview

<p>This project implements a Pre-trained model-based Fire and Smoke Detection System using computer vision techniques and deep learning. 
  The system leverages a ResNet-50 model to detect fire and smoke from camera feeds accurately and displays the results through a cross-platform application built with Flutter.</p>

## Features

<p><ul>
<li>High Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of 86.72% using the ResNet-50 architecture. 
<li>Real-time Detection: Detects fire and smoke in real-time using onsite cameras.
<li>Cross-Platform Application: Displays detection results on multiple devices using Flutter.
<li>Scalable and Efficient: Optimized for computational efficiency and robustness.
</ul>
</p>

## Requirements

<p><ul>
<li>Python 3.x 
<li>TensorFlow
<li>Keras
<li>OpenCV
<li>MySQL Connector
<li>Firebase Admin SDK
<li>Google Cloud Firestore
<li>Dropbox SDK
</ul>
